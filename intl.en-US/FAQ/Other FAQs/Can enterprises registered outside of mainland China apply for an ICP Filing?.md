# Can enterprises registered outside of mainland China apply for an ICP Filing? {#concept_ujc_htl_zdb .concept}

The documents issued outside of mainland China are not accepted for ICP Filing. If you have a registered branch company in mainland China, you can use the registration documents for ICP Filing. If you do not have a registered company, you must apply for a Registration Certificate of Foreign Enterprises Permanent Office in China from the relevant authority and use this as a business license to submit an ICP Filing application. Representative offices in China cannot apply for commercial licenses. However, they can apply for ICP Filing from certain provincial communications administrations.
