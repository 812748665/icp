# What do I do after getting a message from MIIT? {#concept_i2f_ftl_zdb .concept}

## An ICP Filing successful message {#section_v4y_4g5_zdb .section}

An ICP Filing successful message sent from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) indicates that your ICP Filing information has been approved by the authority. However, it takes some time for the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system to synchronize the MIIT review result. During this period, you can resolve your domain name to your Alibaba Cloud ECS instance. After the MIIT review result is synced to Alibaba Cloud, your domain name directing to the Alibaba Cloud ECS instance is accessible.

## An ICP number cancelled message {#section_x4y_4g5_zdb .section}

If you receive a text message that says your ICP number has been cancelled, go to the Public Query page of the MIIT ICP Filing system \(www.miitbeian.gov.cn\) to check. If the ICP number for your domain name has been cancelled, we recommend that you apply for a new ICP number immediately to make your website accessible.

## An invalid ICP Filing message {#section_y4y_4g5_zdb .section}

Invalid ICP Filing means the ICP Filing of a website domain name resolved to an IP address that belongs to a non-access service provider, or the domain name is not valid.  The ICP Filing is still recorded in MIIT system. If you have no other service provider, the ICP number may soon be cancelled by the local communications administration. We recommend that you do as follows:

-   If you are using an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance, you can do as follows.
    -   If the ICP Filing transfer has not been cancelled, direct the website domain to your ECS instance immediately. Make sure your website is accessible.
    -   If the ICP Filing transfer has been canceled, submit an ICP Filing transfer application immediately. After successful transfer, your website is accessible.
-   If  you no longer use Alibaba Cloud servers, transfer the ICP Filing to your new service provider immediately.
