# What will happen if my ICP Filing number is cancelled by the authority? {#concept_k4n_2tl_zdb .concept}

No. Once your ICP Filing number is cancelled by the authority, it cannot be recovered and your website will be inaccessible soon. Â To make your website accessible again, you must submit a new ICP Filing application.
