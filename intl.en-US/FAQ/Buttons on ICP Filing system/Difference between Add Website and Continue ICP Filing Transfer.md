# Difference between Add Website and Continue ICP Filing Transfer {#concept_gbk_dsl_zdb .concept}

If you have already obtained an ICP number through Alibaba Cloud for your subject and website, then you can view two buttons when you log on to the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system \(available in Chinese only\): **Add Website** and **Transfer Another ICP Filing** \(in case that these buttons are not displayed, you may already have another ICP Filing order in progress\).

-   If your website domain name has not ICP filed with MIIT, click **Add Website** and then follow the system prompts to submit an ICP Filing application.

-   If the ICP Filing number is already assigned to a website domain name by MIIT, through a service provider other than Alibaba Cloud, and you now want to host the website on an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance, you must transfer the websiteâ€™s ICP Filing information from the service provider to Alibaba Cloud. To do this, click **Transfer Another ICP Filing** and follow the system prompts to complete the transfer.
