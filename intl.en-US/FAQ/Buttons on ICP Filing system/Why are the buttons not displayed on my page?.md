# Why are the buttons not displayed on my page? {#concept_vgw_csl_zdb .concept}

If the buttons **Modify ICP Filing Information**, **Add New Website for ICP Filing**, **Transfer ICP Filing**, **Cancel Transfer**, or **Cancel ICP Filing** are not displayed in the ICP Filing system, the reasons are as follows:

-   You already have an ICP Filing order in process. You must finish that order or withdraw it before submitting another application.
-   The regulations of the local communications administration do not allow your ICP Filing transfer. Check [ICP Filing rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer).
