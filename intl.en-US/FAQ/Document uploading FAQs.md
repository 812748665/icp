## Considerations for completing the authenticity verification form {#section_z2v_rbt_zdb .section}

Click **Download** to download the form and take a print copy of it. After filling this form, either scan or take a photograph of it and upload the image to the system for review.

Use a black ink pen to fill the form. See [Sample for organizations](http://gtms02.alicdn.com/tps/i2/TB1f.iSJVXXXXXkXFXX6HFAMXXX-1240-1980.jpg) and [Sample for individuals](http://gtms03.alicdn.com/tps/i3/TB11nCSJVXXXXcIXpXXBkJCMXXX-1240-1993.jpg)

The requirements may vary across different local communications administrations. Read the [Rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) carefully.

**Note:** 

-   Organizations: All local communications administration offices require that the authenticity verification form of an organization is stamped with the organization’s official seal.

-   Individuals: Jiangxi and Xinjiang require that for individual ICP Filing, the website administrator must sign and stamp the authentication form with fingerprint. In other regions, individuals are required to clearly sign the form.

-   Form-filling rules for Guangdong are different from the other provinces.  In Guangdong, if the ICP Filing subject is an individual, a form must be handwritten. See [Sample for organizations \(Guangdong\)](http://gtms04.alicdn.com/tps/i4/TB1OyC0JVXXXXaaXpXXA9lwMXXX-1240-1958.jpg)、[Sample for individuals \(Guangdong\)](http://gtms01.alicdn.com/tps/i1/TB1hY54JVXXXXc6XXXX9vlzMXXX-1240-1974.jpg)


## How do I upload a letter of authorization and other materials? {#section_bfv_rbt_zdb .section}

If you are required to upload a letter of authorization or other documents according to the [Rules](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) of the local communications administration, you can make these documents in the same image and upload them together. For example, you can make the organization name change certificate in the same image as the business license, or make the letter of authorization in the same image as the website administrator’s ID documents\).
