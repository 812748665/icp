## Why does my website domain name fail the domain name verification? {#section_hq2_xls_zdb .section}

## What if the domain name is not registered with my own information? {#section_oq2_xls_zdb .section}

The communications administration verifies that the domain name holder information matches the information of the ICP Filing subject or the subject administrator.  If the holder of your domain name is not you or your company, you must change the domain name holder information at your domain name service provider. If your domain name is registered from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\), see the related domain name documentations.

Alibaba Cloud International \(alibabacloud.com\) is an international registrar, so domain names registered with Alibaba Cloud International cannot be used in ICP Filing. registered with the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\) can be ICP filed.

## How do I apply for an ICP Filing when multiple domain names direct to the same website? {#section_pq2_xls_zdb .section}

If you have multiple domain names that direct to the same websites, you only have to enter one of the domain names on the first page of ICP Filing. To add other domain names, click **Add other Domain Names** on the website information entry page \(only available in Chinese\).

 Different provinces/municipalities have different rules for domain name ICP Filing. Guangxi Communications Administration and Chongqing Communications Administration allow only one domain name to be filed for one website. Other communications administrations allow 10 domain names to be filed for a website in one ICP Filing application. If you have more domain names of a website to be filed, you can click  **Save, and Add Another Website** and add another website, which means you must submit another ICP Filing application to file other domain names.

If the domain names direct to different websites, you must finish the information of one website, and then click **Save, and Add Another Website**.

## Do I have to apply for ICP Filing for second-level domain names? {#section_sq2_xls_zdb .section}

You must apply for ICP Filing from the MIIT for domain names that direct to websites hosted on servers in mainland China. After you a top-level domain name is ICP filed, its second-level domain names and other sub-domain names can direct to the server provider space for normal access. You do not need to apply for ICP Filing for these domain names.

-   If the ICP Filing number of your top-level domain name is not obtained through Alibaba Cloud, you must submit an ICP Filing transfer application with Alibaba Cloud for the ICP Filing information of the top-level domain name \(a top-level domain name can have multiple transfer providers\). see [Transfer an ICP Filing](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud and cancel an transfer.md#).
-   According to MIIT regulations, you cannot provide website access using top-level domain names that have not obtained ICP Filing numbers. If a top-level domain name has no ICP Filing number, you must submit an ICP Filing application for this domain name. After the application is approved, its second-level domain names and other sub-domain names can be accessed normally. For more information about the initial ICP Filing process, see [Guide for ICP Filing process](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/ICP Filing for the first time.md#).

## Can I apply for ICP Filing for country-specific domain names and domain names registered outside mainland China? {#section_uq2_xls_zdb .section}

No, you cannot. Only domain names registered in mainland China can be ICP filed with the MIIT.

## How to obtain a domain name certificate? {#section_vq2_xls_zdb .section}

The domain name certificate for the domain name for record may be required as per requirements of some communication administrations. For enterprise ICP Filings, the domain name certificate must be stamped with the company seal.

For domain names registered in mainland China, contact your domain name registrar to download the domain name certificate. If you use a domain name registered from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\), log on to the Domain Name console, click **Manage**. On the Basic Information page, click **Download Domain Name Certificate** and you can download your certificates on the page.

## What if the domain name I recently purchased already has an MIIT ICP Filing number? {#section_wq2_xls_zdb .section}

If the domain name you purchased already has ICP Filing information at the MIIT and this information is not yours,  the reason may be that another user has registered the domain name and obtained an ICP Filing. Go to the Public Query page of the MIIT ICP Filing management system\(www.miitbeian.gov.cn\) to query your domain name information. Then, go to the website of the corresponding provincial/municipal communications administration to download the ICP Filing Cancellation Application Form, and use this form to cancel the ICP Filing information of the domain name. After cancellation, you can reapply for an ICP Filing for this domain name.

## What if the system prompts that my domain name is not supported for ICP Filing? {#section_yq2_xls_zdb .section}

Not all domain names are eligible for ICP Filing. ICP Filing is only provided for domain names indexed by the MIIT. Domain names not approved by the MIIT cannot be used for ICP Filing.

Go to the [MIIT website](http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146285/n1146352/n3054355/n3057709/n3057722/c4416816/content.html)  to query the domain name suffixes supported for ICP Filing. If the domain name you purchased does not support ICP Filing, you can direct it to a server outside the  mainland China. ICP Filings are not required for websites hosted on servers outside mainland China.

## When I submit an application, the system prompts that the subject information for this domain name already exists. What should I do? {#section_zq2_xls_zdb .section}

At the time of application submission on the ICP Filing system, if the system prompts "Subject information for this domain name already exists in the system. Log on with your account and transfer the ICP Filing", you must log on with the account that you used to submit the previous application to finish the ICP Filing.
