## How many ICP Filing subjects can I apply for with a single Alibaba Cloud account? {#section_zgf_kds_zdb .section}

An Alibaba Cloud account only corresponds to one ICP Filing subject \(company or individual\). However, multiple websites are allowed to be ICP filed under one subject. If you want to apply for multiple ICP Filing subjects, you must submit applications using different Alibaba Cloud accounts.

## Can the ICP Filing account be different from the account used to purchase the domain name or server? {#section_ahf_kds_zdb .section}

The Alibaba Cloud account used for ICP Filing does not have to be the account used to purchase the domain name or server, which means that you can submit an ICP Filing application with an account that is not used to purchase the domain name or server. The account information does not affect the review of your ICP Filing application.

## How to import information from the old HiChina ICP Filing management platform to the new Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing platform? {#section_ghf_kds_zdb .section}

If you have obtained an ICP Filing through the old HiChina ICP Filing management platform or obtained an official store/ company website ICP Filing before January 2017, log on to the ICP Filing system to import the filing information to your Alibaba Cloud account.

The procedure is as follows:

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](http://beian.aliyun.com/) \(only available in Chinese\) and click **Import ICP Filing Information** from the upper-right corner of the page.

3.  Enter the account ID and password used for ICP Filing on the former ICP Filing platform. After verification, you can import your filing information to the new platform.

    If you forget your account ID or password for the HiChina platform, you can click to [ICP Filing Account Email Initialization](https://beian.aliyun.com/account/changeLoginName.htm) or [Password Retrieval](https://beian.aliyun.com/account/find_pwd?spm=a3c00.7621318.a3c20.5.v2Fcab) to find back your account name or password.

## What can I do if I forget my logon ID of the old HiChina ICP Filing system? {#section_mhf_kds_zdb .section}

If you cannot retrieve the password for your account on the old HiChina ICP Filing system, click [ICP Filing Account Email Initialization](https://beian.aliyun.com/account/changeLoginName.htm), enter your ICP Filing information, and upload your credentials to reset your ICP Filing account. Note that this operation replaces your original ICP Filing email account. Alibaba Cloud processes your application within one or two business days.

After completing account email initialization, you can use your new account to log on to the ICP Filing system. We recommend that you click [Password Retrieval](https://beian.gein.cn/account/find_pwd?spm=a3c00.7621318.a3c20.3.HzSvcU) to reset your password.

**Note:** 

-   Prepare necessary documents in advance.

    Individual: A scanned copy or photograph of the front and back of the original ID card of the ICP Filing applicant, and a half-length photograph of the applicant holding the ID card.

    Organization: A half-length photograph of the applicant holding the valid credential of the ICP Filing subject. If the applicant is not the subject administrator or website administrator, provide a letter of authorization from the organization based on the relevant template and stamp the letter with the company seal. You must also provide an original scanned copy or photograph of the applicant’s ID card \(front and back if second-generation ID cards\). Click to download the [Authorization letter template](https://beian.gein.cn/account/downloadChangeLoginSqs.do?spm=0.0.0.0.yZztDa&file=downloadChangeLoginSqs.do).
