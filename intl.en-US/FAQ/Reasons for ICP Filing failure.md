# Reasons for ICP Filing failure {#concept_fpx_srl_zdb .concept}

If your ICP Filing application is rejected, you must correct the information according the failure reasons, and submit it for review again.

Your filing information is first reviewed by the Alibaba Cloud. Once the review is passed, your filing information is forwarded to the local communications administration. After your filing information passes the communications administration review, the ICP Filing is successful.

If your ICP Filing application is rejected, it means that some information you submitted does not meet the ICP Filing requirements. In this case, you must update the data based on the reasons for rejection as per the requirements of the local communications administration, and then submit the ICP Filing application again.

-   Your domain name is within the validity period.
-   Your domain name has passed the real-name authentication.
-   The information of the ICP Filing subject conforms with the real-name authentication information of the domain name registrant \(domain name owner\).

When reviewing the ICP Filing information, the communications administration checks whether the domain name meets the ICP Filing requirements and whether the information of the ICP Filing subject is consistent with that of the domain name owner \(including the name, ID card number, business license, and other information\). The ICP Filing application will be rejected if the domain name owner is different from the ICP Filing subject, even though the domain name meets the ICP Filing requirements.
