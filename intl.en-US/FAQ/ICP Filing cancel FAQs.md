## What is the difference between cancelling a subject registration and cancelling a website registration? {#section_unw_x3t_zdb .section}

**Cancelling a subject registration** deletes all the information for the ICP Filing number at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\). The ICP Filings of all the websites under the subject are cancelled.

**Cancelling a website registration** deletes the ICP Filing information for a specific website. After cancellation, your ICP Filing subject still exists and the other websites that are not cancelled under the subject remain unaffected.

For operation procedures, see [Cancel ICP Filing](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Cancel an ICP Filing.md#)

## How does it take for a website become inaccessible after cancellation? {#section_vnw_x3t_zdb .section}

After the communications administration approves the cancellation, the website becomes inaccessible. You can apply for ICP Filing for the subject or website again after you cancel the old one.

## How long does the cancellation review take? {#section_wnw_x3t_zdb .section}

It usually takes 3 to 20 business days for the communications administration to review a cancellation application.

## Does canceling a website registration affect other websites under the same subject? {#section_xnw_x3t_zdb .section}

Canceling the registration of a website only deletes the ICP Filing information for the selected website. Other websites with ICP Filings under the same subject are not affected.

## Can I cancel a website registration and reapply for a new ICP Filing at the same time? {#section_ynw_x3t_zdb .section}

You cannot cancel an ICP Filing and reapply for a new ICP Filing at the same time.  You must wait for the cancellation application to be approved by the communications administration.  Then, go to the Public Query page of the MIIT ICP Filing management system \(www.miitbeian.gov.cn\) and make sure that no ICP Filing information is returned before submitting a new ICP Filing application.
