# Product verification FAQ {#concept_jyc_xrl_zdb .concept}

When you submit ICP Filing application through Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system, the system verifies your ECS instances.

## Why did I fail the product verification? {#section_ogq_tws_zdb .section}

After you submit product verification information, if you see "Invalid product information", "ICP filing information already submitted", or other prompts, it indicates that the product verification fails.

Possible reasons for verification failure and corresponding solutions are as follows:

-   If the information you entered is incorrect, the system prompts "Invalid product information". In this case, verify that the selected product type matches the product you purchased. For an ECS instance,  select **Alibaba Cloud** and use the ICP Filing service code for verification.
-   If the system prompts "A website ICP Filing application has already been submitted for this product. The ICP Filing subject quantity limit has been reached. Please switch to another product", it indicates that the ICP Filing subject quota of the current server has been reached. In this case, we recommend that you switch to another ECS instance for product verification.
-   If the system prompts "Product information verification failed. Interface exception",  it indicates that the ICP Filing service code is invalid. In this case, verify that the ECS instance you used to apply for the ICP Filing service code has not expired. If the ECS instance has expired, the service code is invalid. In this case, apply for an ICP Filing service code using a valid ECS instance.
