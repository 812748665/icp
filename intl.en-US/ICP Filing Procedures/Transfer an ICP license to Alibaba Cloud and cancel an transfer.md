# Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud and cancel an transfer {#concept_n4f_krl_zdb .concept}

If your website domain name has been ICP filed through another service provider and now your website is hosted by an Alibaba Cloud server, you must transfer your ICP Filing license to Alibaba Cloud.

Two type of ICP license transfer:

-   [Transfer an ICP Filing](#section_ss5_rrz_zdb): the ICP Filing subject has never used Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system before.
-   [Transfer another ICP Filing](#section_int_j5z_zdb): the ICP Filing subject has filed with Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system before.

If you no longer use the Alibaba cloud server to host your website, you must [cancel the ICP Filing transfer](#section_ugl_tvz_zdb).

**Note:** 

-   To transfer an existing ICP Filing license, you only need to add Alibaba Cloud as your service provider. The other filed information remains unchanged.

-   Your ICP Filing data at previous service provider is not affected. You can use the servers of both service providers.

-   You must follow the local [ICP Filing regulations](https://beian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer).

-   If the subject information has been filed with Alibaba Cloud and you want to transfer a website domain name of this subject filed through another service provider to Alibaba Cloud, click Transfer Another ICP Filing to Alibaba Cloud on your ICP Filing system homepage.  If you are a HiChina ICP Filing platform user, you must import your ICP Fling information from the  HiChina ICP Filing platform to Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system first. For more information about HiChina platform, see [ICP Filing system FAQs](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/48581.html).

    If you file with the communications administration of Guangdong, Chongqing, Liaoning, Anhui, and Fujian, you can use Alibaba Cloud app to upload documents and verify the website administrator.

7.  After your information passes Alibaba Cloud review, log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm) to upload a picture of the website administrator as required for verification.

    **Note for Shanghai users: ** Shanghai Communications Administration requires that ICP Filing applicants in Shanghai **must** use Shanghai Communications Administration app \(only available in Chinese\) to verity the website administrator. For more information, see [Using Shanghai communications administration app to verify the website administrator](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator.md#).

    For other regions, ICP applicants can select one of several designated places, which are scattered in most major cities in China, to take an official photo as part of the application process. This rule demands the applicants to physically present in China long enough to have a picture taken. However, Alibaba Cloud can make it easier. You can apply for an official background \(that is, “photo backdrop”\) from the document uploading page of your ICP Filing process. Click **Enter your address**, and enter an address of mainland China.。 Alibaba Cloud can mail the photo backdrop to any region in mainland China. The website administrator takes a picture in front of the backdrop and upload the picture. Do not wear in red or blue when taking the picture.

    After receiving eligible pictures and approving your application, Alibaba Cloud submits the application to the communications administration for approval. You are notified by an email and a text message.

8.  Verify the mobile phone number of the subject and website administrators. Currently, mobile phone verification is supported in Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Other provinces do not require mobile phone number verification.
