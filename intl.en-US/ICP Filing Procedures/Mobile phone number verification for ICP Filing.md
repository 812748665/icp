# Mobile phone number verification for ICP Filing {#concept_sjg_4rl_zdb .concept}

According to the “Notice of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on the Implementation of Basic Management of the Internet \(MIIT information management letter \[2016\] No. 485\)”, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\) launches the text message verification for the mobile phone numbers of the subjects and website administrators.  That is, when the ICP Filing information is approved and submitted by Alibaba Cloud to the competent authority for review, the subject and/or website administrator receives a text message containing verification codes sent by the MIIT.  ICP Filing subjects and website administrators must complete the text message verification within 48 hours. Currently, this system is piloted in Tianjin, Gansu, Tibet, Ningxia, Hainan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai.  If you submit ICP Filing applications to the communications administrations in these provinces,  you must complete the text message verification before the application can be admitted into the system of the provincial/municipal communication administrations for review. When receiving a text message with verification code, log on to the website of the provincial/municipal communications administration \(only available in Chinese\) and enter the verification information to complete verification.  If you fail to verify the mobile phone number within 48 hours,  the filing information is rejected.

## Verification code sending principles {#section_ytb_rb1_12b .section}

-   For new ICP Filing, ICP Filing transfer, or ICP Filing information change, a text message containing the verification code is sent to the mobile phone number of the subject and/or website administrator.
-   If the subject and website administrator are the same person, only one text message is sent for verification \(the subject and the website administrator are determined to be the same person only if their mobile phone numbers are the same\).
-   The verification code is only sent to the mobile phone number entered in the Contact method 1 field in the filing information.
-   If this phone number has been changed in the filing information, the verification code is sent to the new mobile phone number.
-   The verification code is a six-digit number.
-   Verification code sending frequency and interval: After you receive a notification that Alibaba Cloud has submitted your ICP Filing information to the communications administration, you will receive the verification text message in about five minutes. The MIIT system sends another verification code at 12:00 the next day. You can also go to the website of corresponding provincial/municipal authority to manually resend the verification text message.

## Verification code validity {#section_yyd_mzx_zdb .section}

The verification code is valid for 48 hours.  Within 48 hours,  you must go to the website of corresponding provincial/municipal authority, and enter your ID number, mobile phone number, and verification code to complete the verification.

After you complete text message verification for your mobile phone, your filing information enters the authority's review process. If you do not verify the mobile phone number within 48 hours,  or the verification fails, your ICP Filing information is automatically returned to your service provider \(Alibaba Cloud\).  In this case, you must resubmit the ICP Filing application and perform text message verification again.  After you complete the text message verification, your ICP Filing application information is delivered to the provincial/municipal authority for review.

## Verification code sending number {#section_zyd_mzx_zdb .section}

China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile users receive the verification codes sent by a fixed number. No fixed verification code sending number for virtual carrier users.

-   China Telecom: 106598051001
-   China Unicom: 10655113
-   China Mobile: 106575000130
-   The number used for sending messages to virtual carrier numbers varies with the target number types and carriers.

## What if I did not receive a verification text message? {#section_ozd_mzx_zdb .section}

After you receive the notification that Alibaba Cloud has submitted your ICP Filing information to the competent authority for review,  generally, you will receive a verification text message within five minutes.  If you do not receive a text message after five minutes, check and make sure that:

-   Your mobile phone network is normal.
-   You have not enabled text message blocking service or installed any anti-spam software.

Solution:

-   If you cannot receive text messages because of poor signal, move to another area for better network reception. Or you can go to the website of the relevant authority and manually resend the verification text message.
-   If you are using a spam message blocker or an anti-spam software, disable it.  If you cannot disable the anti-spam function on your mobile phone, insert your SIM card to another mobile phone.
-   If you wrong deleted the verification text message, you can visit the filing Department of Provincial Administration website, for manual re-transmission; or wait for the letter department system to re-issue the verification code at 12 noon the next day.

If you do not complete text message verification within 48 hours, the ICP filing system automatically returns your filing application. In this case, you must resubmit your ICP filing application.
