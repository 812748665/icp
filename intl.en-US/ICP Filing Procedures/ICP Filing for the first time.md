# ICP Filing for the first time {#concept_ghz_3rl_zdb .concept}

If your website domain name has not been ICP filed with MIIT, and you use an Alibaba Cloud server to host the website, you must apply for an ICP Filing number for the domain name in Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system.

**Note:** In accordance with the official application process, the Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system is only available in Chinese. Therefore, you must complete the application in Chinese. In case of any problems, contact us. You must pay attention to the ICP Filing rules of the MIIT. For personal website, you must read [Personal website naming requirements](../../../../intl.en-US/FAQ/Subject and website information FAQs.md#section_rdk_mvr_zdb).

## Prerequisites {#section_cd2_xyy_zdb .section}

-   Read the local [ICP Filing regulations](https://icpbeian.aliyun.com/#MapDataContainer) carefully. If you want to know more about MIIT requirements, access [MIIT website](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/).
-   Purchase an ECS instance with a subscription for at least three months and with an Internet IP.

-   You must register your domain name from a China-based domain name provider \(for example, aliyun.com\).  Alibaba Cloud International is an international service provider, so domain names registered from Alibaba Cloud International \(alibabacloud.com\) are not supported by the MIIT ICP Filing system. We recommend that you register the domain name for ICP Filing from the Chinese site of Alibaba Cloud \(aliyun.com\).

    The domain name verification is successful only when the following criteria are met:

    -   The domain name provider must receive the approved certificate from the Chinese authority.
    -   The top-level domain name must be approved by the Chinese authority.
    -   The domain name must be in its validity period.
    -   The domain name has passed the real-name authentication. The ICP Filing subject information must be consistent with the domain name registrant \(domain name holder\) information.
-   You must keep scanned copies or photos of your identifications and other required documents handy.
    -   Individual must provide scanned copies or photos of the front and back of ID cards.
    -   Organizations must provide scanned copies of the registration certificate, scanned copies of the front and back of the ID card of the person in charge of ICP Filing, and an authentication document duly stamped with the official seal of the company.
-   Prepare a website ICP Filing authenticity statement. You must download the template of ICP Filing authenticity statement from the Document Uploading page of ICP Filing system.

    **Note:** Some local administrations have special requirements for the ICP Filing authenticity statement, so we do not recommend you download the template from other sources.

-   Prepare other documents required by the local administrations. For example, domain name certificates  and residence permit.

After you submit your ICP Filing information for Alibaba Cloud review, make sure that your phone number is in service and the call is answered during the normal working hours in China. If we find any problem , we contact you by the phone number in your ICP Filing information.

6.  After your information passes Alibaba Cloud review, log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/selfBaIndex.htm) to upload a picture of the website administrator as required for verification.

    **Note for Shanghai users: ** Shanghai Communications Administration requires that ICP Filing applicants in Shanghai **must** use Shanghai Communications Administration app \(only available in Chinese\) to verity the website administrator.  For more information, see [Using Shanghai communications administration app to verify the website administrator](intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Using Shanghai Communications Administration app to verify the website administrator.md#).

    For other regions, ICP applicants can select one of several designated places, which are scattered in most major cities in China, to take an official photo as part of the application process. This rule demands the applicants to physically present in China long enough to have a picture taken. However, Alibaba Cloud can make it easier. You can apply for an official background \(that is, “photo backdrop”\) from the document uploading page of your ICP Filing process. Click **Enter your address**, and enter an address of mainland China. Alibaba Cloud can mail the photo backdrop to any region in mainland China. The website administrator takes a picture in front of the backdrop and upload the picture. Do not wear in red or blue when taking the picture.
