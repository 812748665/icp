# A statement required by Guangdong communication authorities {#concept_wnm_ngm_zdb .concept}

In Guangdong province, if your website involves financial content, you must provide a website ICP Filing statement.Â  The format is not fixed, but the content must be truthful and complete.

Considerations:

-   Describe the business of the company, the website content, and financial-related content in plain language.

-   Completely describe the business scope.

-   State that never engage in any online financial services before obtaining the permission.

-   For enterprise ICP Filing, the statement must be given in the name of the enterprise.

-   The statement must have long-term validity instead of being temporary or only valid for a specific stage.

-   The statement must be stamped with the official company seal and signed by the legal representative, and the company business license must be attached.
