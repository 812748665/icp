# Website construction plan for Guangdong {#concept_akm_pgm_zdb .concept}

According to the requirements of Guangdong Communications Administrations, domain names with different prefixes must be filed individually.  If multiple domain names are under the ICP Filing subject \(including domain names that already have ICP Filing numbers and the domain names to be filed\), a website construction plan is required besides the authenticity verification form.

Enterprise: In case of 32 or more different domain name prefixes, website construction plans for each domain name and the Alibaba Cloud letter of guarantee stamped with the seal for ICP Filing are required.

Individual: In case of 6 or more different domain name prefixes, website construction plans for each domain name are required. In case of 10 or more different domain name prefixes, website construction plans for each domain name and the Alibaba Cloud letter of guarantee stamped with the seal for ICP Filing are required.

No specific templates are for the website construction plan. You can create one based on your own website plans, but it must contain the following information:

-   Website content and section introductions \(with design illustrations\).

-   Personnel and funding arrangements \(including personnel qualifications, competencies, and backgrounds.  If the website is run by an individual, specify whether the individual is a full-time or part-time employee, how the individual allocates time to website work, and the individual’s personal policy awareness and technical competencies\).

-   Content management system.

-   Network deployment scheme \(including what technologies are used and where the website is deployed\).

-   Technical measures for network information security.

-   Contingency plans.
