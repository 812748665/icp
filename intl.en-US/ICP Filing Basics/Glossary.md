ICP Filing is a license issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\). If you use a server located in mainland China to host your website or use the CDN service in mainland China, you must apply for Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) Filing.

Two types of Filing:

-   ICP Filing:  known in Chinese as “Bei’An”, is the first level of ICP certification. All websites hosted in mainland China must be ICP filed with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\).  Alibaba Cloud ECS instance and CDN users apply for an ICP Filing number through [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](https://beian.aliyun.com/).
-   ICP Commercial License: known as “ICP Zheng” in Chinese, allows online platforms or third-party sellers of products and services to deploy their websites on hosting servers or use CDN within mainland China. To apply for an ICP Commercial License, you must first obtain an ICP Filing. You must apply for an ICP Commercial License from the local authorities.

Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud: If you have obtained an ICP license for a domain name with a service provider other than Alibaba Cloud, and now you want to bind the domain name or the sub-domains with Alibaba Cloud servers, you must transfer the ICP Filing license to Alibaba Cloud.

Modify ICP Filing information: Change the recorded information of the ICP Filing subject or the websites.

Add new websites for ICP Filing: An ICP Filing subject, who has filed ICP records through Alibaba Cloud before, now has a new website hosted on an ECS instance to be ICP filed.

Add new websites for ICP Filing \( new Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing users\): An ICP Filing subject, who has filed ICP records through a service provider other than Alibaba Cloud, now has a new website hosted on an ECS instance to be ICP filed.

Claim an ICP Filing: The domain name was successfully filed for ICP record through HiChina before June 2010, and now the owner wants to claim the domain name ICP Filing record by using an Alibaba Cloud account.

ICP Filing service code: An ICP service code is used as a verification code to verify that the website is hosted on an Alibaba Cloud server. You must enter a service code on  [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system](http://beian.aliyun.com/) to verify your ECS instance. An ICP Filing service code is like this: 32a43232-a888-88e8-b9ec-00888be8888f. You can apply for an ICP service code for your instance from [ICP No. Application](https://bsn.console.aliyun.com/).

ICP Filing password: Each ICP number has a dedicated password issued by the MIIT. You are prompted to enter the ICP Filing password when you modify an ICP Filing information or cancel an ICP Filing at the time of application submission. If you forget your ICP Filing password, you can retrieve it from the MIIT website \(http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn\). Click **Retrieve password**, and retrieve the password following the procedures.

ICP Filing authenticity statement: You must download the corresponding template of the authenticity statement on the Upload Document page, and upload it after you complete your statement according to the instruction.

Cancel an ICP Filing: If an ICP Filing subject or a domain name is no longer valid or used, you must cancel the ICP Filing information. Two types of cancellation:

-   Cancel the subject: All the information of the subject and the domain names are deleted.  You can apply for an ICP Filing using the subject information again after you cancel the old one.
-   Cancel a website: The filing information of a website is deleted. However, the ICP Filing subject remains valid and other non-cancelled websites of the subject remain unaffected.

Cancel an ICP Filing transfer: If you cancel an ICP Filing transfer-in, the association between your filing information and Alibaba Cloud is deleted. Alibaba Cloud does not serve as your service provider any more, and the domain name does not point to an Alibaba Cloud server. However, your ICP Filing with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is still effective. Contact your server provider in use to submit an application for ICP Filing transfer. Otherwise, your filing information may be deleted by the competent authority.
