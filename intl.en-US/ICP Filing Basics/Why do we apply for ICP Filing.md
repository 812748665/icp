# Why do we apply for ICP Filing {#concept_nx4_hql_zdb .concept}

According to the "Regulation on Internet Information Service of the People’s Republic of China \(Decree No. 292 of the State Council\)" by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\),  your website cannot direct to any server located in mainland China for public visit until you get an ICP Filing license from MIIT. If the region of your ECS instance is not in mainland China, you do not apply for ICP Filing license.

There are two ICP certification types:

-   ICP Filing: known in Chinese as “Bei’An”, is the first level of ICP certification. All websites hosted in mainland China must be filed with MIIT. You must apply for an ICP Filing through your service provider. Alibaba Cloud ECS instance users must apply for ICP Filing on Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system \(only available in Chinese\). You can perform the following ICP Filing on Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system: [First ICP Filing](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/ICP Filing for the first time.md#), [Transfer an ICP Filing](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Transfer an ICP license to Alibaba Cloud.md#), [Add a website for ICP Filing \(for new Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing system users\)](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Add new websites for ICP Filing (New Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing users).md#) and [Add a website for ICP Filing \(for old Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing users\)](../../../../intl.en-US/ICP Filing Procedures/Add new websites for ICP Filing ( Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing users).md#).

-   ICP Commercial License: known in Chinese as “ICP Zheng”, allows online platforms or third-party sellers of products and services to deploy their websites on hosting servers or use CDN within mainland China. To apply for an ICP Commercial License, you must first obtain an ICP Filing. You must apply for an ICP Commercial License from the local communications administrations directly \(not through Alibaba Cloud\). Visit the website of the local communications administration to view the specific procedures and requirements.


**Note:** According to the latest amendments in 2016, after procuring the ICP Filing number or ICP Commercial License, you must submit an application to the PSB \(Public Security Bureau\) for [PSB filing](../../../../intl.en-US/FAQ/PSB Filing FAQs.md#) within 30 days after you launch your website.

If you are using an Alibaba Cloud instance in a mainland China region to host your website, log on to the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing platform](https://beian.aliyun.com/) \(only available in Chinese\) to submit a filing application.
